  # attachments

  # Ok, we have to process attachments first, because of the way RT processes incoming
  # emails / returns history in its API.  The content of the ticket request in the email is
  # stored as a set of attachments (not just one becaue the email will be multipart/mixed, e.g. Gmail
  # will send both an HTML and a plain text version, etc...)  I haven't looked closely at the RT code
  # to determine how it decides which attachment to render in the web UI, but the net result from the API
  # is that when you get the transaction history, the Content of the transaction object will usually not
  # be the meaningful content you want (in my case, it was an email footer that was tacked on by mailing list
  # software before the email hit RT).  To get to the valuable content, you have to process the attachments
  # and extract the stuff you want.  Since I am migrating to Redmine, I want that initial content to be in
  # the issue description.  RT doesn't have that concept of a ticket description - the request is just the first
  # thing in the ticket history.  So we have to fudge a bit.

  # process attachments for this ticket, if any
  # this means both "real" attachments, as in someone put a file on the ticket, and incoming emails, which get
  # parsed into a series of attachments, and are not always reflected in the ticket history from the API like
  # you'd expect.  All this business about parents refers to the way that RT breaks apart an email into various
  # attachments that have parent-child relationships.

    # basic pattern is that an incoming email will have 1 or more 0b attachments as parents
    #(multipart/mixed, or multipart/alternative content types, I believe) and then those will have multiple
    #children (RT attachments have the concept of a parent attachment we can use to determine children)
    # - basically, we MAY want to preserve text/plain children.  Some text/plain children are email footers
    # - I believe at one time our incoming requests were routed through mailing list software before being forwarded to RT,
    # and the mailing list added a footer
    # - these can be distinguished from other text/plain children by looking at the Headers...
